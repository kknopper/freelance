	<h2>Sales</h2>
	<p>It is hard to imagine a sales professional reaching his/her potential without learning and utilizing some sort of sales process. Sure, many sales professionals operate by instinct. And a few do it quite well, becoming top earners in their industries. The shortcoming of this approach, however, is that when we wing it, it is hard for us to develop consistency and produce predictable outcomes. If we are merely reacting in the moment based upon what your “gut” tells us to do in any given moment it is nearly impossible to create a systematic approach that we can follow every meeting. Over and over again.</p>

Before you make one move toward closing a sale you will know exactly what to do and why you are doing it.
