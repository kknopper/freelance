<h3 class="question">What makes EPIC different from other groups?</h3>
<div class="answer">
	<p>
		There are two principle differentiators: The focus of our meeting and
		the one-on-one coaching in between meetings.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whereas other groups focus on organization, process and execution EPIC
		focuses exclusively on business development. What must happen for
		members to significantly grow their businesses in as short as time as
		possible? (e.g. 30% in the next 180 days).
	</p>
	<p>
		Tim’s one-on-one clients pay him as much as $60,000 per year to coach
		them. You get access to Tim for fraction of that cost. Tim is a no
		nonsense, tells it like it is coach that has help thousands of clients
		just like you explode through to the next level.
