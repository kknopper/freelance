		<h1>Whitelist Instructions – Make sure you get your email!</h1>
		<h2>You will need to <span class="italic">‘whitelist’</span> my email address to ensure you receive updates from me regarding the product you purchased, or other content you requested!</h2>
		<p>Due to email service providers trying to limit the amount of SPAM, lots of <span class="italic">‘good’ emails</span> (like mine) are getting caught up in filters or not delivered…especially ones with download links to purchased programs.</p>
		<p>To make sure you GET your content, as well as updates, I need your help to make sure you get your stuff!</p>
		<h3>Follow These Instructions for <span class="italic">Gmail</span>:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>In your inbox, locate an email from <strong>support or tim@thepersontosee.com (ex. your welcome email, or purchase email).</strong></li>
			<li>Drag this email to the <strong>primary</strong> tab of your inbox.</li>
			<li>If/when a box pops up and asks you: Do this for all future messages from tim@thepersontosee.com? Click YES!</li>
			<li>You’ll see that our emails will go to your primary folder in the future…and you won’t miss a thing!</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>For other email service providers</h3>
		<p>For <strong>Yahoo, MSN, Hotmail, AOL, etc</strong>. please add: <strong>tim@thepersontosee.com</strong> as a contact in your address book. Further whitelist instructions for almost all email providers as well as Outlook, Mac Mail, etc., can be found by <strong><a href="https://www.whatcounts.com/resources/checklists/how-to-whitelist-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLICKING HERE</a>.</strong></p>
		<p>As a side note… if you ever get tired of my emails (I can’t imagine why that would ever happen), you can always unsubscribe at any time by clicking ‘unsubscribe’ at the bottom of EVERY email I send.</p>
		<p>BUT, before you do that, I would appreciate it if you just hit ‘reply’ and let me know what I could do to add more value to YOU or how I could improve things!</p>
		<p>Remember You Are Your Best Bet!<br>- Tim O'Brien</p>
